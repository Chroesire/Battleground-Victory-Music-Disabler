# Battleground Victory Music Disabler


This mod disables victory music for battlegrounds in World of Warcraft. The way it works is very simple: it uses WoW's capability to override in-game sounds to replace the victory music with silent audio files.

By default, both Alliance and Horde victory music are disabled, but this can be changed by simply deleting the silent audio file for the faction you want to keep music for.


## Installation
Because of the nature of this mod, installation is a little different than that of your typicaly addon, but is still quite simple:

1. [⬇️ Download the mod ⬇️](https://github.com/Chroesire/Battleground-Victory-Music-Disabler/archive/1.0.zip)
2. Unzip it.
2. Navigate to your WoW install.
   - For Windows users, this is usually C:/Program Files/World of Warcraft/
   - For Mac users, this is usually /Applications/World of Warcraft/
3. Open your WoW install's \_retail_ folder.
4. Copy the Sounds folder included in this mod into the \_retail_ folder.

5. You're done! Launch WoW and win (or lose) those battlegrounds in sublime silence!
